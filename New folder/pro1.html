      <p>The Great Wall of China is a series of fortifications made of stone, brick, tamped earth, wood, and other materials, generally built along an east-to-west line across the historical northern borders of China to protect the Chinese states and empires against the raids and invasions of the various nomadic tribes of the Eurasian Steppe.</p>
      <p>It is the longest wall in the world, stretching over 13,000 miles. The Great Wall is not a single continuous wall, but is made up of many walls and fortifications, some of which date back to the 7th century BC.</p>

      <div id="moreInfo" style="display: none;">
        <p>Construction of the Great Wall began in the 7th century BC and continued through to the Ming dynasty (1368-1644). The Great Wall was built to protect China from invasion by nomads, but it also served as a symbol of the power and wealth of the Chinese empire.</p>
        <p>The Great Wall is not visible from space with the naked eye, as is often claimed, but it is visible from low Earth orbit. The Great Wall has been restored and maintained over the centuries, and today it is a popular tourist destination, attracting millions of visitors each year.</p>
