        <p>The structures at Machu Picchu were constructed using a technique called "ashlar," in which stones were cut to fit perfectly together without the use of mortar. The most impressive structure at Machu Picchu is the Temple of the Sun, which features a carved stone altar and a large sundial. The Intihuatana Stone, another important structure at Machu Picchu, is believed to have been used for astronomical observations.</p>
        <p>Machu Picchu is the network of terraces that surround the city. The terraces were used for farming and allowed the Inca to grow crops in the mountainous terrain. The terraces are still in use today and are considered an important example of Incan engineering.</p>
