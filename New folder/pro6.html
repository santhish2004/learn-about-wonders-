      <p>Chichen Itza is an ancient Mayan city located in the Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico. The site is considered one of the most important archaeological sites in Mexico and is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The city was once a major center of Mayan civilization and is now one of the most popular tourist destinations in Mexico.</p>
      <p>One of the most famous structures at Chichen Itza is the Kukulcan Pyramid, also known as El Castillo. The pyramid is a 98-foot tall structure with four sides, each containing 91 steps, and a temple at the top.</p>

        <p> Chichen Itza is the Great Ballcourt, which is the largest and best-preserved ball court in Mesoamerica. The ballcourt is 545 feet long and 225 feet wide and has walls that reach up to 50 feet high. It is believed that the Mayans played a game called "Pok-a-Tok" in the ballcourt, which involved hitting a rubber ball through stone hoops using only their hips.</p>
        <p>The Temple of the Warriors is another impressive structure at Chichen Itza. The temple features a series of columns carved in the likeness of warriors, as well as depictions of jaguars, eagles, and other animals. The temple is believed to have been used for religious ceremonies and was dedicated to the Mayan god of war.</p>
