        <p>The Colosseum was commissioned in 70-80 AD by Emperor Vespasian as a gift to the Roman people. It was designed to be a place of entertainment and recreation, but also to showcase the power and wealth of the Roman empire.</p>
        <p>The Colosseum was in use for nearly 500 years, but was eventually abandoned and fell into disrepair. Today, much of the Colosseum has been destroyed, but much of the original structure still stands and has been restored, and it is a popular tourist destination and a symbol of Rome and its rich history.</p>
